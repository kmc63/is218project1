                    <p>A docker is image is a configuration file for docker containers.
                    Docker images are like a list of instructions that are completed
                    in order to build a docker container. This docker image can be used
                    to build as many docker containers as you like. Also, another way
                    to look at docker images is to think of them as a snapshot of a
                    virtual machine.</p>

                    <h1>Containers</h1>
                    <p>A docker container is a lightweight, standalone application that
                    is based off the instructions from a docker image. The docker container
                    will have the bare minimum of configuration and dependencies installed
                    to get its desired application running. The greatest benefit of
                    containers is they take much less hardware to run than VMs which allows
                    you to run much more containers than VMs.</p>
