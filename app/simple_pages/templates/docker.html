                    <p>A docker is image is a configuration file for docker containers.
                    Docker images are like a list of instructions that are completed
                    in order to build a docker container. This docker image can be used
                    to build as many docker containers as you like. Also, another way
                    to look at docker images is to think of them as a snapshot of a
                    virtual machine.</p>

                    <h1>Containers</h1>
                    <p>A docker container is a lightweight, standalone application that
                    is based off the instructions from a docker image. The docker container
                    will have the bare minimum of configuration and dependencies installed
                    to get its desired application running. The greatest benefit of
                    containers is they take much less hardware to run than VMs which allows
                    you to run much more containers than VMs.</p>

                    <h1>Docker In The Terminal</h1>
                    <p>I am able to start my project by going to the directory that has my
                    docker-compose.yml script in a terminal. Once I get there I will need to
                    use the command docker-compose up which will bring the project up. Now in
                    another terminal I need to run the command docker ps to get a list of running
                    containers. Docker ps also gives you the container ID which you will need to
                        directly access the container. And you get access to the container by using
                        the command docker run -it containerID /bin/bash this will give you internal
                    access to the docker container.</p>
